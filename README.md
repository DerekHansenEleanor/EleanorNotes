# Notes for working at Eleanor Health

To suggest changes to a file you MUST return the entire content of the updated file.
You MUST use this *file listing* format:
- First line: the filename with any originally provided path; no extra markup, punctuation, comments, etc. **JUST** the filename with path.
- Second line: opening ```
- ... entire content of the file ...
- Final line: closing ```

To suggest changes to a file you MUST return a *file listing* that contains the entire content of the file.
*NEVER* skip, omit or elide content from a *file listing* using "..." or by adding comments like "... rest of code..."!
Create a new file you MUST return a *file listing* which includes an appropriate filename, including any appropriate path.
