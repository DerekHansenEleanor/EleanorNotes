Mehul Meet & Greet
  Onboarding Experience

      Derek shared that his experience at Eleanor Health has been good so far, though he prefers staying busy and is still getting up to speed with the systems.
      Mahul assured Derek that once he fully ramps up, he will have plenty of work to do.

  Discussion on Salesforce & Integrations

      Mahul provided an overview of the Salesforce integration at Eleanor Health.
      Salesforce is central to managing leads from multiple sources, including marketing campaigns, payer lists, and partner organizations.
      Leads are processed through BigQuery and integrated into Salesforce via Skivia.
      The team has been working to reduce dependencies on external vendors (like Redox) and take more control of Athena API integrations.
      Appointment scheduling and synchronization between Athena, BigQuery, and Salesforce were discussed, with challenges around handling multiple provider calendars and real-time updates.

  Mahul’s Role & Collaboration

      Mahul has been at Eleanor Health for a couple of years and leads efforts in improving operational efficiency through Salesforce and its integrations.
      He works closely with marketing, access, and sales teams outside of the tech team.
      While daily maintenance of integrations takes up much of his time, he also works on larger projects and solution designs.

  Derek’s Background & Skills

      Derek provided an overview of his experience in back-end software engineering, consulting, and leading software teams.
      While he has touched Salesforce before, he is looking forward to learning more about its implementation at Eleanor Health.

  Casual Conversation

      They discussed their personal backgrounds, including Mahul’s extensive experience with Salesforce across various industries.
      Derek shared his airline travel experience, including his recent around-the-world trip.

  Next Steps

      Mahul invited Derek to reach out with any questions about integrations.
      Derek offered to help with anything that needs an extra pair of eyes, as he is not yet overwhelmed with tasks.

Training w/ Brad
  1. **Infrastructure Overview**: You reviewed the existing codebase and system architecture, noting that the architectural diagrams were up to date. Terraform is being used extensively for infrastructure as code.
