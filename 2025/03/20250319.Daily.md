  Derek, Tom 1:1
    - Derek was asked to lead a kickoff meeting for a minimal project focused on automating the freezing and unfreezing of appointment slots in the Athena scheduling system. The key objectives of the meeting include:
      Aligning Stakeholders – Derek needs to set up a meeting with Mahal, Tom, and Jake, with an optional invitation for another stakeholder who has upcoming travel conflicts.
      Understanding the Current System – Tom will walk Derek through the existing architecture and processes in place.
      Defining the Scope – The team will focus on implementing a microservice that listens for appointment events (bookings and cancellations) and automates slot freezing/unfreezing in real-time.
      Testing and Rollout Plan – The initial implementation will be tested in the preview environment with a select group of providers before expanding across departments.
      Follow-Up – After the first sprint, Derek will report back on progress, assessing whether the project is ready for testing or if further refinement is needed
