# Axle <> Redox Sync
This is a transcript of a meeting between representatives from Eleanor (a healthcare organization) and Redox (a health data exchange platform), with the goal of integrating their systems.

The meeting covers several topics:

1. **Integration Phases**: The teams discuss the integration phases, which include kickoff, connectivity, configurations, testing, training, and go-live.
2. **Connectivity Phase**: They agree that this phase will involve connecting Redux to LNR (Eleanor's existing system) with no real meaningful involvement from Axel.
3. **Configurations**: Both teams will work on configuring the integration during this phase.
4. **Testing Phase**: Redox will lead integrated testing, and Eleanor's teams will provide input on user acceptance testing.
5. **Training and Support**: The teams agree to coordinate training and support for each other's systems.

The meeting also covers practical details:

1. **Meeting Schedule**: They schedule a weekly check-in call with the goal of dedicating 30 minutes per week to discussing progress.
2. **Calendar Coordination**: Tom, one of Eleanor's representatives, will be traveling next week and will not be able to participate in meetings for that time period. The others will help coordinate calendars if anyone wants to drop off from future meetings.
3. **Time Commitment**: The teams discuss the need to understand each other's time commitments to ensure effective collaboration.

Key actions and decisions made during the meeting include:

1. Establishing a weekly check-in call with 30 minutes of dedicated time for discussion.
2. Coordinating calendars for future meetings, with Tom's travel plans noted.
3. Agreeing on a rough outline of the integration phases and responsibilities for each phase.

Overall, the meeting aims to establish a clear plan for integrating Eleanor's system with Redox's health data exchange platform, ensuring effective collaboration and communication between both teams.
