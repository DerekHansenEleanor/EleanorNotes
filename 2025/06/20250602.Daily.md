# Derek/Jake: 1-on-1

Mon, 02 Jun 25 · jake.cunninghame@eleanorhealth.com

### Top of mind

Jake is working on the Athena scheduling proof of concept but encountering significant API challenges. RCX rules access issue occurred and was resolved by Derek.

### Updates and wins

- Derek resolved RCX rules access issue by resetting Cloudflare configuration
- Jake has made some progress investigating Athena scheduling API capabilities
- Jake can see appointment slots in the preview environment UI for providers across multiple locations (NJ and OH)

### Challenges and blockers

- Athena API Documentation Issues:
  - Missing access to necessary User Admin API for provider grouping
  - Jake found potential workaround but spent “a couple days” figuring this out
- API Technical Issues:
  - Cannot query appointment slots via API despite visibility in preview environment
  - Production API credentials in Doppler (for data jobs/hub server) lack proper permissions
  - Jake: “endpoints are not responding the way I thought they would”

### Mutual feedback

Jake expressed that despite frustrations, he’s enjoying the new challenge: “I have been a little frustrated couple of days, but I have also enjoyed working on it. It’s a little bit different than what I have been doing.”

### Next Milestone

- Jake will:
  - Continue testing additional API endpoints and query parameters
  - Try testing with different providers who have overlapping schedules
  - If no progress by end of tomorrow/Wednesday, will seek Athena support
- Derek offered to:
  - Be available for shadowing/pairing later today
  - Help set up Athena support if needed
- Administrative:
  - Jake to submit remaining Boston expense receipts (one lunch receipt pending)
