# Derek/Thom: 1-on-1

Mon, 30 Jun 25 · thom.ribeiro@eleanorhealth.com

### Personal Updates

- Derek experiencing migraine issues from recent high-altitude exposure (helping sister move)
- Derek lives at ~2,000 ft elevation due to health considerations (history of stroke ~6 years ago)
- Office will be closed for Independence Day (July 4th)

### Project Status - Axle Integration

- Axle integration likely to supersede current slot freezing work
- Thom paused slot freezing work - only completed investigation and foundation improvements
- No wasted development effort as only database improvements were implemented
- Axle appears to have minimal, straightforward API with few endpoints
- Project timeline targets October for completion
- Tomorrow: Kickoff meeting with stakeholders to define implementation details

### Technical Considerations

- Discussion about implementation location ([eleanorhealth.com](http://eleanorhealth.com) vs. ops hub)
- Thom recommends using ops hub provider application due to:
  - Existing login permissions
  - HIPAA compliance
  - Avoiding PHP/WordPress complications
- Project likely to be frontend-heavy
- Potential for drag-and-drop functionality requirement
- May leverage AI code generation tools for frontend development

### Personal Development

- Thom’s focus areas:
  - Retiring scheduling application
  - OpenAI vendor integration
  - Exploring new AI tools and workflows
- Planned AI workshop with Derek, Jake, and Thom
- No major technical debt concerns beyond scheduling application

### Next Steps

- Review Axle developer documentation
- Attend tomorrow’s stakeholder kickoff meeting
- Continue supporting market expansion work
- Consider AI tool integration for frontend development
- Monitor Axle implementation requirements and timeline
