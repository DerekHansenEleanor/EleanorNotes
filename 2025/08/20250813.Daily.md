## Notes

# Tom 1 on 1
Summary:

The conversation is about the technical aspects of an online platform, specifically regarding the setup and maintenance of services such as Doppler, Kubernetes, and Tableau. The team discusses various issues and concerns, including debugging, security, and documentation.

Action Items:

1. Update the technical architecture diagram to include information on Doppler and Kubernetes services.
2. Create a separate diagram for business stakeholders that excludes technical details.
3. Review the current list of technology services to identify any missing items or duplicates.
4. Investigate creating service accounts instead of individual Google accounts for accessing credentials.
5. Discuss with Alex about providing shared credentials in a controlled way using a password manager.
6. Develop a plan to secure credentials and prevent unauthorized access when team members leave.
7. Research solutions for managing Tableau services, including whether each operator needs the credentials or if it's possible to configure data services independently.

Notes:

* The conversation mentions that there is currently no technical architecture diagram in place, which will need to be created.
* There are concerns about security and ensuring that credentials are not easily accessible by team members who leave.
* The team discusses the importance of documentation and having a stable state for the architectural diagrams.

# Athena Axle Sync
Summary:

The conversation involves a meeting between two partners (Speaker 1 and Speaker 2) with an external party (Jay) from Athena Health. The discussion revolves around integrating Athena Health's services with another company's system, Redox, for scheduling purposes. Jay shares information about Athena Health's API endpoints and how they can help map insurance plans. The conversation also touches on project management, timelines, and potential risks.

Action Items:

1. Jay will provide the API endpoint to Athena Health.
2. Speaker 4 will work with Speaker 2 to communicate the project scope to Redux and Axel.
3. Rebecca will have a conversation with Axel about the integration, using the provided API endpoint.
4. Tommy (Speaker 1) wants to get a demo of the current experience, possibly including a Figma prototype, to help Jay understand the process better.
5. Speaker 2 will share their recording of the meeting with Jay for reference.
6. Speaker 4 will leverage Jay's expertise in validating the integration process.
7. Jake (Speaker 1) needs to find test patients with the required ROI form from Athena Health's data warehouse.

Key points:

* Athena Health is no longer the front-end for scheduling, and Axel Health will take over.
* There are API endpoints available for mapping insurance plans.
* Project timelines are important, particularly for the last three weeks of September leading up to October 1st.
* Speaker 2 has a dedicated schedule, allowing for quick collaboration and solution validation.

# Axle Sync
It appears that this is a transcript of a meeting between a team representing JotForm (a workflow automation platform) and a team representing Axle (a healthcare management platform). The purpose of the meeting is to discuss how JotForm's workflow can be integrated with Axle's system.

The topics discussed include:

1. Integration of JotForm with Axle: The teams are discussing how to integrate JotForm's workflow with Axle's system, specifically regarding provider profiles and data mapping.
2. Provider profiles: The teams are discussing how to map JotForm's clinician profiles to Axle's provider tables, using a combination of Athena (Axle's database) and Google authentication (for unique IDs).
3. Data mapping: The teams are discussing how to map data points from Axle's provider table to JotForm's system, including adding metadata to individual clinician records.
4. Integration challenges: The teams are addressing potential integration challenges, such as trust issues with appointment creation and revenue tracking.

Overall, the meeting appears to be focused on ensuring that the integration between JotForm and Axle is successful and meets the requirements of both systems.
